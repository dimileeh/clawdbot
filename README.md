# clawdbot

AI agent swarm orchestration for production codebases.

A shell-first toolkit for spawning coding agents into isolated git worktrees, tracking their progress, automating PR reviews, and driving a safe human-in-the-loop merge loop. Zero LLM cost when idle — monitoring scripts only wake the orchestrator when something needs attention.

## How it works

## Prerequisites

- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) — installed and authenticated
- `git` — version control
- `gh` — [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com), authenticated with repo + PR permissions
- `tmux` — agent sessions run here
- `jq` — JSON processing
- Node.js — managed via [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- At least one coding agent CLI:
  - [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)
  - [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
  - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)

## Installation

Clone directly into `~/.clawdbot` — the repo IS the runtime directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USER/clawdbot.git ~/.clawdbot
cd ~/.clawdbot
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your repos, GitHub owner, paths, etc.
```

### Agent Authentication

Coding agents need access to their provider's API. There are two ways to authenticate:

**Option A: CLI OAuth login** (recommended — no keys to manage)

Log in once on your machine, and all spawned agents inherit the session:

```bash
codex auth     # OpenAI / Codex CLI
claude login   # Anthropic / Claude Code
gemini auth    # Google / Gemini CLI
```

Credentials are stored in your home directory (`~/.codex/`, `~/.claude/`, etc.). Since `spawn-agent.sh` runs tmux as the same user, agents pick them up automatically.

**Option B: API keys** (for headless servers or CI environments)

Set keys in `~/.clawdbot/.env` — only the ones you use:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."          # Codex CLI
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."   # Claude Code
GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..."         # Gemini CLI
```

`spawn-agent.sh` sources `.env` before launching agents, so keys are automatically available. `.env` is gitignored and never committed.

You can also set keys in your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`) — same effect.

Create the runtime directories:

```bash
mkdir -p logs prompts runners memory
```

Set up crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
```

```cron
# Agent pre-check (validate GitHub API, repos accessible)
*/10 * * * * /home/YOU/.clawdbot/agent-precheck.sh >> /home/YOU/.clawdbot/logs/precheck.log 2>&1

# PR manager (merge, review-fix, sync PRs)
*/10 * * * * /home/YOU/.clawdbot/pr-manager.sh >> /home/YOU/.clawdbot/logs/pr-manager.log 2>&1

# Swarm monitor (zero-LLM, wakes orchestrator only on events)
*/3 * * * * /home/YOU/.clawdbot/swarm-monitor.sh
```

## Connecting to your OpenClaw agent

clawdbot is the infrastructure — your OpenClaw agent is the brain that drives it. You need to tell your agent that `~/.clawdbot/` exists and how to use it.

### 1. Tell your agent about clawdbot

Add this to your workspace `AGENTS.md` (or `HEARTBEAT.md`):

```markdown
## Coding Agent Swarm

~/.clawdbot/ contains the swarm orchestration toolkit.
- Spawn agents: `~/.clawdbot/spawn-agent.sh <task-id> <repo> <branch> <agent> <model> <thinking> "<prompt>"`
- Check status: `~/.clawdbot/check-agents.sh`
- Clean up: `~/.clawdbot/cleanup-task.sh <task-id>`
- PR status: `~/.clawdbot/pr-unified-status.sh`
```

### 2. Install the swarm skill (recommended)

The [swarm skill](https://clawhub.ai) gives your agent structured knowledge of the full spawn → monitor → review → merge lifecycle:

```bash
openclaw skill install swarm
```

With the skill installed, you can just say *"spawn a Codex agent to fix the auth bug in my-backend"* and your agent handles the rest — worktree creation, prompt injection, tmux session, and monitoring.

### 3. How the pieces connect

```
You (chat with your OpenClaw agent)
 ↓
"Fix the auth bug and add the dashboard feature"
 ↓
OpenClaw agent reads swarm skill → calls spawn-agent.sh (×2)
 ↓
Coding agents work in isolated worktrees → push → open PRs
 ↓
swarm-monitor.sh (cron) detects CI failure / PR ready
 ↓
`openclaw cron wake` → wakes your agent
 ↓
Agent auto-fixes CI, resolves reviews, notifies you when ready
 ↓
You review and merge to main
```

The cron jobs (`swarm-monitor.sh`, `pr-manager.sh`) are the glue — they run pure bash with zero LLM cost, and only wake your OpenClaw agent when something actually needs attention.

### 4. Customize AGENTS.md

`AGENTS.md` is injected into every spawned agent's worktree. This is where you encode your team's standards:

- TDD requirements
- Code style and conventions
- Git commit format
- PR description template
- Which skills to load
- What NOT to do

Edit it to match your workflow. The default covers TDD, conventional commits, and clean code.

## Configuration

All config lives in `.env` (gitignored). Copy `.env.example` and fill in your values:

```bash
# Required
CLAWDBOT_REPOS="owner/backend owner/frontend"    # Space-separated repos
CLAWDBOT_GITHUB_OWNER="owner"                     # GitHub org or user
CLAWDBOT_PROJECTS_ROOT="$HOME/Projects"           # Where repos are cloned

# Branch strategy
CLAWDBOT_INTEGRATION_BRANCH="development"         # Agents target this
CLAWDBOT_MAIN_BRANCH="main"                       # Humans merge here

# Paths
CLAWDBOT_HOME="$HOME/.clawdbot"                   # This directory
CLAWDBOT_NODE_PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v24.13.0/bin"

# Notifications (via OpenClaw)
CLAWDBOT_NOTIFY_CHANNEL="telegram"
CLAWDBOT_NOTIFY_TARGET="YOUR_CHAT_ID"

# Agent defaults
CLAWDBOT_DEFAULT_AGENT="codex"
CLAWDBOT_CODEX_MODEL="gpt-5.4"
CLAWDBOT_CLAUDE_MODEL="claude-opus-4-6"
CLAWDBOT_GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-2.5-pro"

# Optional
CLAWDBOT_SKILLS_PATH="$CLAWDBOT_PROJECTS_ROOT/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills"
CLAWDBOT_DEPENDABOT_REPO="owner/frontend"         # Auto-merge dependabot PRs here
```

Every script sources `.env` on startup with safe fallbacks, so existing env vars also work.

## Usage

### Spawn an agent

```bash
~/.clawdbot/spawn-agent.sh \
  <task-id> \
  <repo-path> \
  <branch-name> \
  <agent: codex|claude|gemini> \
  <model> \
  <thinking: low|medium|high|xhigh> \
  "<prompt>"
```

Example:

```bash
~/.clawdbot/spawn-agent.sh \
  fix-auth-bug \
  ~/Projects/my-backend \
  fix/auth-bug \
  codex \
  gpt-5.4 \
  xhigh \
  "Fix the auth refresh token race condition. Add tests. Open a PR against development."
```

### Check running agents

```bash
~/.clawdbot/check-agents.sh | jq .
```

Returns JSON with task IDs, statuses, PR numbers, CI state, and recommended actions.

### PR status across repos

```bash
~/.clawdbot/pr-unified-status.sh    # Overview of all open PRs
~/.clawdbot/check-pr-ready.sh       # Which PRs are ready to merge
~/.clawdbot/check-pr-review-debt.sh # Which PRs need review attention
```

### Clean up a finished task

```bash
~/.clawdbot/cleanup-task.sh <task-id>
```

Removes the worktree, deletes the branch (if merged), and removes the task from the registry.

## The review loop

Two cron jobs form the core automation:

**`swarm-monitor.sh`** (every 3 min) — Pure bash, zero LLM cost. Reads `check-agents.sh` output and only wakes the OpenClaw orchestrator when:
- A PR's CI failed and needs a fix agent
- A PR is ready for merge/review
- A branch has merge conflicts

**`pr-manager.sh`** (every 10 min) — Handles repo-wide PR lifecycle:
- Auto-merges integration PRs when CI is green and reviews are approved
- Blocks merges if a release PR (integration→main) is already open
- Spawns isolated agents to fix unresolved review threads
- Spawns agents to fix CI failures
- Opens integration→main sync PRs when the dev queue is clear
- Notifies via OpenClaw when PRs need human attention

The result: agents code, push, get reviewed, fix review feedback, and re-push — all without human involvement until the final merge to main.

## Safety rails

- **Runtime `gh` wrapper** — `spawn-agent.sh` generates a `gh` shim in a temp dir that rejects PRs not targeting the integration branch
- **Worktree isolation** — each task gets its own worktree; no cross-contamination
- **Human-only main merges** — PRs to main are never auto-merged
- **State files** — all automation state is in readable JSON files
- **Cron announces deltas** — only notifies when something changes, not on every run
- **No direct pushes to main** — enforced by convention and the gh wrapper

## Supported agents

| Agent | CLI | Default flags |
|-------|-----|---------------|
| Codex | `codex exec` | `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, configurable model + reasoning |
| Claude Code | `claude` | `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, configurable model |
| Gemini | `gemini` | `--yolo`, configurable model |

Adjust defaults in `spawn-agent.sh` or override via `.env`.

## Agent skills

Coding agents perform better with domain-specific knowledge. We use **[Antigravity Awesome Skills](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills)** — 883+ agentic skills for AI coding assistants.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git \
  "$CLAWDBOT_PROJECTS_ROOT/antigravity-awesome-skills"
```

Skills are referenced in `AGENTS.md` and loaded by agents at startup. Examples:
- `tdd-workflow` — RED→GREEN→REFACTOR cycle
- `clean-code` — naming, readability, function design
- `fastapi-pro` — async Python + FastAPI patterns
- `nextjs-best-practices` — App Router conventions
- `docker-expert` — multi-stage builds, security
- `code-reviewer` — review guidelines, security scanning

Create your own skills too — it's just a `SKILL.md` file with instructions.
